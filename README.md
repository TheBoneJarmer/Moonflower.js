# ArqanoreJS
ArqanoreJS is a rough javascript translation of my other framework, Arqanore, which is a 2D OpenGL framework for .net applications. However, ArqanoreJS works with WebGL and therefore works slightly different due do the differences between OpenGL and WebGL. Also, due the language differences the structure is obviously different. But I tried to keep names and signatures similar. This project is still rather new and much a work in progress.

## Installation
Kinda stupid to add this section since it is just one freakin' .js file, but oh well. For the sake of clarity, here goes. Copy _Arqanore.js_ to your working folder and add it to your html file.

## Usage
Yes well.. still working on this. But do look at the examples for now. They **should** work or else I f*cked up.

## Contribution
You are free to send in pull requests anytime. But do open up a ticket first with the feature you like to add or the bug you like to fix. Otherwise I won't know what you changed code for. Thanks in advance!
